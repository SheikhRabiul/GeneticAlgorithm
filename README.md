# GeneticAlgorithm

### A genetic algorithm for selecting optimal feature combinations with sklearn supervised ML objects

See the docstring of GeneticAlgorithm.py for a brief explanation for how this works  

### To do  

- Add plotting functionality for the progression of fitness  
- Test with various datasets and sklearn classifiers/regressors
- Parallelize the model training since this takes a long time
